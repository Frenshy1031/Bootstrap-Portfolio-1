            <strong>Howdy!</strong> My name is Marion Omar Ong and I am based in New York City. I am currently pursuing a bootcamp in Full Stack Web Development at Columbia University's Fu School of Engineering. I have done many things and had a few job titles in the preceding years, but none has been as fulfilling and frankly more exciting than my relentless pursuit of traveling around the world. Under my Instagram tag of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jetset.panda/" class="stealthlink">@jetset.Panda</a>, I have chronicled my adventures in over 40 countries in all of the <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Americans-have-visited-six-continents" class="stealthlink">six inhabited continents</a>. Its been a great journey so far and I would like to develop the joy and passion that I experienced during my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jetset.panda/" class="stealthlink">jetsetPanda</a> years into a viable business related to the travel industry. It just so happens that I will need solid web development skills to achieve that goal. So here I am at Columbia Bootcamp! Also, its already 2019 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)" class="stealthlink">Skynet</a> is STILL not operational, so I'm here to lend a helping hand! <a href="http://terminator.wikia.com/wiki/Cyberdyne_Systems" class="stealthlink">Cyberdyne</a>, if you're listening, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jetset.panda/" class="stealthlink">like and follow me on IG!</a>

            I have had corporate experience involving web design and deployment. In one of my previous positions, at Deloitte I worked at their Global Conferences Group and created information webpages on all of the firm's events while adhering to their strict branding standards and design language. I also created and deployed online registration forms for each event and using custom web applications to utilize the data to collaborate with the on-site event planners who are managing the logistics of these events at multiple concurrent locations around the world. I have also worked as a freelance web designer in creating static and dynamic websites using tools such as Dreamweaver, Wordpress, Wix and Salesforce, and have had many a happy and satisfied personal and small business clientele. I am truly excited to be on this life changing learning path and look forward for what's to come!
